1)MVC Pattern Overview:

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.
It's an architectural pattern used in software development to organize and structure applications.
It separates an application into three distinct components: Model, View, and Controller.

2)Components of MVC:
----------------------------------------------
Model: Responsible for managing data-related logic.

Handles data transfer between View and Controller.
Manages business logic-related data.-->Means logics like algo which you have written for the purpose

Examples: Customer object managing data retrieval, manipulation, and updates.

-------------------------------------------
View: Handles user interface (UI) logic.

Deals with UI components such as text boxes, dropdowns, etc.
Presents data to the user and receives user input.
Example: Customer view displaying UI elements for user interaction.
-----------------------------------------------
Controller: Acts as an intermediary.

Processes business logic and incoming requests.
Communicates with Model to manipulate data.
Interacts with View to render the final output.
Example: Customer controller managing interactions between Customer Model and View.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)Roles of Each Component:

Model:

Manages data and database-related operations.
Handles business logic.
Performs data manipulation and storage.

View:

Handles UI components and layout.
Displays data to users.
Receives and forwards user input.

Controller:

Orchestrates communication between Model and View.
Handles user requests and input.
Executes business logic and updates data.

4)Interaction Flow:

A user interacts with the View.
The View forwards user input to the Controller.
The Controller processes input, interacts with the Model if needed, and updates data.
The Controller decides which View to display next and updates it.
The View displays the updated data or UI to the user.

5)Benefits of MVC:

Clear separation of concerns: Each component has a specific role.
Modularity and maintainability: Components can be developed and modified independently.
Reusability: Components can be reused in different parts of the application.
Scalability: The structure allows for easier scaling and expansion.

6)Application in Web Development:

MVC is commonly used in web development frameworks.
Helps in creating scalable and extensible web projects.
Organizes code for better development and maintenance.
