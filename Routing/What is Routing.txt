What is Routing in laravel?
Routing is the process of determining the best path for a packet to travel from its source to its destination. 
It is performed by routers, which are devices that connect different networks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two main types of routing: static and dynamic.
 Static routing is where the routes are manually configured by the network administrator. 
 Dynamic routing is where the routers use routing protocols to exchange information
  about the network topology and dynamically determine the best routes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The routing process involves the following steps:

The router receives a packet from a sender.
The router looks up the destination IP address in its routing table.
If the destination IP address is in the routing table, the router knows the next hop router to forward the packet to.
The router forwards the packet to the next hop router.
The next hop router repeats steps 2-4 until the packet reaches its destination.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The routing table is a database that stores information about the routes to different destinations. 
The routing table includes the following information for each route:

Destination IP address
Next hop router
Cost of the route-The cost of the route is a measure of the distance between the router and the destination
Metric used to determine the best route
